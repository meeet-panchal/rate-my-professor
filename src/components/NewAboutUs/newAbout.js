              Find what you need to live the college life to the fullest -
              professors information, university rankings, honest feebacks and
              more.Let's say a graduate of a course says, "The teacher is
              amazing!" Even while that's a wonderful comment, there isn't
              really anything in it that the student who is about to start the
              course can apply. <bR></bR>

              The student who comes in learns something useful if they write,
              "concentrate on the textbook more than the worksheets or
              assignments in studying for the tests," yet the same student did.
              Because of this, the new survey asks a particular topic rather
              than making generic remarks. We intend to provide results that are
              more beneficial to others by concentrating the reaction. The
              question can also be changed to maintain the emphasis on the
              subject at hand rather than the student.

              First, it was determined that the website needed to reaffirm its
              purpose, concentrating on the response to the query "what do I as
              a student need to know to optimise my likelihood of success in a
              certain class?" After that, it was off to confer with experts in
              psychology and education. To replace the outdated rating method,
              experts created a succinct yet effective survey. The pupils'
              agreement would then be tested. In a study to see if the new
              survey would give them more relevant, actionable information, over
              1,100 students participated, and the result was a resounding
              "yes."

              But what should be done with all the ratings gathered over time?
              It was agreed to keep sharing the historical rating data up till
              we had gathered enough fresh surveys. The legacy remarks are an
              another matter. While some of the comments were critical and
              others were not, we discovered that the majority weren't really
              useful.
